Axis Interoperability ¶

The Apache Axis project is one of the most popular SOAP implementations around, so it was very important for soaplib to easily work with it. As a subproject of soaplib the axis_soaplib test suite was created to make sure soaplib and Axis can understand each other. This test uses Apache Ant to run the tests and generates the client-side java classes using the wsdl2java command.
How to run the test ¶

    * Start the soaplib interop service from the soaplib directory

       % python tests/interop_service.py

    * Modify the build.xml in axis_soaplib to reflect the correct url and path to the axis library
    * run the tests

      % ant
      Buildfile: build.xml

      wsdl2java:

      compile:

          [javac] Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.
          [javac] Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.

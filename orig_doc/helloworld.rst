Hello World 

This example uses the CherryPy webserver to deploy this service
Declaring a Soaplib Service 

from soaplib.wsgi_soap import SimpleWSGISoapApp
from soaplib.service import soapmethod
from soaplib.serializers.primitive import String, Integer, Array

class HelloWorldService(SimpleWSGISoapApp):

    @soapmethod(String,Integer,_returns=Array(String))
    def say_hello(self,name,times):
        results = []
        for i in range(0,times):
            results.append('Hello, %s'%name)
        return results
        
if __name__=='__main__':
    from cherrypy._cpwsgiserver import CherryPyWSGIServer
    # this example uses CherryPy2.2, use cherrypy.wsgiserver.CherryPyWSGIServer for CherryPy 3.0
    server = CherryPyWSGIServer(('localhost',7789),HelloWorldService())
    server.start()

Dissecting this example: SimpleWSGISoapApp is the base class for WSGI soap services.

from soaplib.wsgi_soap import SimpleWSGISoapApp

The soapmethod decorator exposes methods as soap method and declares the data types it accepts and returns

from soaplib.service import soapmethod

Import the serializers to for this method (more on serializers later)

from soaplib.serializers.primitive import String, Integer, Array

Extending SimpleWSGISoapApp is an easy way to soap service that can be deployed as a WSGI application.

class HelloWorldService(SimpleWSGISoapApp):

The soapmethod decorator flags each method as a soap method, and defines the types and order of the soap parameters, as well as the return value. This method takes in a String, an Integer and returns an Array of Strings -> Array(String).

@soapmethod(String,Integer,_returns=Array(String))

The method itself has nothing special about it whatsoever. All input variables and return types are standard python objects.

def say_hello(self,name,times):
    results = []
    for i in range(0,times):
        results.append('Hello, %s'%name)
    return results

Deploying the service 

deploy this web service. Soaplib has been tested with several other web servers, This example uses the CherryPy WSGI web server to and any WSGI-compliant server *should* work.

if __name__=='__main__':
    from cherrypy._cpwsgiserver import CherryPyWSGIServer
    server = CherryPyWSGIServer(('localhost',7789),HelloWorldService())
    server.start()

Calling this service 

>>> from soaplib.client import make_service_client
>>> from helloworld import HelloWorldService
>>> client = make_service_client('http://localhost:7789/',HelloWorldService())
>>> print client.say_hello("Dave",5)
['Hello, Dave','Hello, Dave','Hello, Dave','Hello, Dave','Hello, Dave']

soaplib.client.make_service_client is a utility method to construct a callable client to the remote web service. make_service_client takes the url of the remote functionality, as well as a _stub_ of the remote service. As in this case, the _stub_ can be the instance of the remote functionality, however the requirements are that it just have the same method signatures and definitions as the server implementation.
